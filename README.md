This website was built to give an active grooming business in Reno, Nevada a presence on the web.  It was one of the first projects I coded from scratch for a living business.  Working with the business owners to conceptualize and refine the design, and building out the gallery and Book Appointment pages, was an invaluable process.  I also purchased the domain for them  (lisaspamperedpaws.com) and created an A record in the DNS settings to serve the site from my GitHub Page.  Planned enhancements to this website include a Blog, a "Specials" page, and eventually, scheduling functionality on the Book Appointment page (the business owners preferred not to offer online booking at this time).
